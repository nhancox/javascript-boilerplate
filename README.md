# JavaScript Boilerplate

Boilerplate for JavaScript projects with opinionated linters and formatters.

Quickly get a project up-and-running with in-depth linting rules and automatic
formatting. All staged files get linted in a pre-commit hook.

Scripts are included in the `package.json` to run every type of lint and format
operation. However, it's highly recommended to have your editor run these
operations on save, as well.

## Install

1. Clone repository
2. Delete what you don't need
3. Update the README and `package.json` for the new project

## Possible Future Updates

- Installation script to get rid of unnecessary files and mark what commit the
  clone occurred at
- Stylelint integration
- Yarn depending on how the version 2 upgrade shakes down (currently has
  conflicts with some packages)
- Instructions for editor integration (definitely VS Code, maybe Vim)
